# Overview

Here you can find:

* **LF1_LF2_HF**  
Processing of sequence and taxonomy table of all household fermentations (HF) and laboratory fermentation 1 & 2 (LF1 & LF2) using Phyloseq and ggplot2
* **LF3**  
Processing of sequence and taxonomy table of laboratory fermentation 3 (LF3) which compares the DNA-based versus the RNA-based 16S rRNA sequencing of the fermentation
* **Phylogenetic placement**  
All necessary scripts for running the phylogenetic placement of the ASVs on a 16S rRNA tree. A huge thank you to [Stijn Wittouck](https://github.com/SWittouck) for conceptualising and performing this analysis
